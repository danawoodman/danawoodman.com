Wanted to do redirects in your SvelteKit endpoints and tried to `return { redirect: '/success' }` just to find out it doesn't work?

Well, you're in luck because you can just use the standard `Location` header to do redirects:

```js
export async function get() {
  // Do some magic here... âœ¨

  return {
    headers: { Location: "/success" },
    status: 302,
  };
}
```

Remember to make sure use the [proper status code](https://httpstatusdogs.com/) for your redirect.

Learn more about the [`Location` header on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Location).

Whelp, that's it for today, hope this saved you some headaches!
